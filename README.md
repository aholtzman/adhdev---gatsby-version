# ADH front end developer portfolio

This is the second iteration of my front end developer portfolio.

The first build was made with React (create-react-app) as a single page web app, the repo can be found at https://github.com/aholtzman/adh-dev

Since then I have started to use [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) for building static websites and decided to create an entirely new version of the site while taking the opportunity to apply a new design and structure to the project.
